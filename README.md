# discordAtWar v2
Pew pew pew but polished


# What is this madness?
This is the bot used in the Italian discord-RP KOI, you can make wars with it and from 23/March/2021 it's being updated and rewritten as I came back on working at it, you can still find the first original code in the "legacy" branch. Please always link this repos as source. 

## What features are in the bot?
- [x] Classes for players (Infantry, arty, ships, cavalry)
- [x] Commands for get cover and for aiming
- [x] Commands for shooting
- [ ] Commands for use torpedos (only ships) __WIP__
- [x] Commands for melee fighting (only land classes)

#### I want to contribute! 
That's awesome, feel free to contact me in anyway you want to __(post scriptum: do not ring at my door, thanks)__  and I will review your code and add it in the file along with credits

# DISCLAIMER
Please, do not ask me basic questions about how to make this work, before trying to use this at least learn how to make a "ping/pong" bot, then try to do something with this code.

I am working on a tutorial so I can rest while people watch that instead on asking me "how to create a bot".
