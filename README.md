# discordAtWar v2
Pew pew pew but polished


# What is this madness?
This is the bot used in the Italian discord-RP KOI, you can make wars with it and from 23/March/2021 it's being updated and rewritten as I came back on working at it, you can still find the first original code in the "legacy" branch. Please always link this repos as source. Some of the code is still in Italian, total translation is on the way.

## What features are in the bot?
- [x] Classes for players (Infantry, arty, ships, cavalry)
- [x] Commands for get cover and for aiming
- [x] Commands for shooting
- [ ] Commands for use torpedos (only ships)
- [ ] Commands for melee fighting (only land classes) __WIP__

#### I want to contribute! 
That's awesome, feel free to contact me in anyway you want to __(post scriptum: do not ring at my door, thanks)__  and I will review your code and add it in the file along with credits

# Node dependencies:

# DISCLAIMER
Please, do not ask me basic questions about how to make this work, before trying to use this at least learn how to make a "ping/pong" bot, then try to do something with this code.
