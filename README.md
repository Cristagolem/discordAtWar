Pew pew pew


# What is this madness?
It's a bot I used to make wars in an Italian discord-RP called KOI, this code has been used for almost a year and it went through an enormous process of changes as also in the meanwhile I became better in coding in JS so don't expect this to be perfect, also part of the code is in Italian but every needed translation is provided in comments. Please always link this repos as source.

## What features are in the bot?
- [x] Classes for players (Infantry, arty, ships, cavalry)
- [x] Commands for get cover and for aiming
- [x] Commands for shooting
- [ ] Commands for use torpedos (only ships)
- [ ] Commands for melee fighting (only land classes)

#### I want to contribute! 
That's awesome, feel free to contact me in anyway you want to __(post scriptum: do not ring at my door, thanks)__  and I will review your code and add it in the file along with credits

# Node dependencies:
> discord.js (latest stable/v12)

# DISCLAIMER
Despite what I was thinking, many are asking me questions about how to use it and let me just say it, this code is for people who ALREADY know how to make a bot, you need to know the basic things to make a "ping/pong" bot at least using DiscordJS else it is pointless for you even trying because I won't answer any more questions on such basilar things.
Also I will NOT provide support for the code if some things get deprecated, it's up to you, I may decide to but do not take it for granted.
