# What is this madness?
It's a bot I used to make wars in an Italian discord-RP called KOI, this code has been used for almost a year and it went through an enormous process of changes as also in the meanwhile I became better in coding in JS so don't expect this to be perfect, also part of the code is in Italian but every needed translation is provided in comments.

# Node dependencies:
discord.js (latest stable/v12)

# DISCLAIMER
Despite what I was thinking, many are asking me questions about how to use it and let me just say it, this code is for people who ALREADY know how to make a bot, you need to know the basic things to make a "ping/pong" bot at least using DiscordJS else it is pointless for you even trying because I won't answer any more questions on such basilar things.
